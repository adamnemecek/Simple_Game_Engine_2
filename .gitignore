# I only want to track select files, so ignore everything, then selectively 
# un-ignore certain extensions, then extend that un-ignoring to all subfolders.

# ignore everything
*

# keep source files (including "inline" files) and ReadMe and shader files
!*.cpp
!*.h
!*.inl
!*.txt
!*.vert
!*.frag

# keep the demo file, which contains the project files plus the middleware folder
!*.zip

# we want to keep these around
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# keep solution and  project files and filters so we can see how they change 
# through the project
!*.sln
!*.vcxproj
!*.vcxproj.filters

# now unignore all sub-folders that are not the glsdk middleware folder
# Note: I want to put the arcsynthesis framework into the repo because I have 
# to modify it from it's original version (VS2010 and for an older glsdk) to 
# work with my VS2013 solution.
